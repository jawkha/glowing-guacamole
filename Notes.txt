The project is to create the website in React. We can do it in the following sequence:

1. Create the skeleton for the project with the following main elements:
	index.html	--- that's where the site will be displayed
	index.css	--- that's where all the styles for the app will be defined
	index.js	--- that's the root file for javascript where the App will be rendered
	App.js 		--- that's where the whole app will be structured using React Router

2. Create separate components for the following sections:
	A. HEADER
		1. Logo							------- SKELETON DONE
		2. Navigation					------- SKELETON DONE
		3. Donate Button				------- SKELETON DONE
	B. BODY
		a. Home
			1.	HomeBannerImage			------- NOT DONE

3. Once all the components are built, we will add the required functionality to them. The ones that won't have any interactivity will be converted into Stateless Functional Components.

4. CREATE JSON FILES WITH DETAILS OF MENTORS, SPONSORS, AND CORE TEAM 

5. All the styles for the app will be finalized in index.css. Bootstrap will also be used.

6. Using React Router, all the routes and links will be setup.
7. Website will be tested for mobile use, accessibility, and performance.
