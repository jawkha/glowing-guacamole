			<h2>WHAT DO WE DO?</h2>
			<p>We train refugees to become software-developers</p>
			<p>
				In our 6-month program we train talented refugees with and<br/>
				without a coding background in modern JavaScript software<br/>
				development. Our aim is to have our students land their first<br/>
				software development job after finishing our course, and we do<br/>
				everything we can to prepare them as well as possible. With our<br/>
				team of over 35 experienced senior developers we have created a<br/>
				program around the special needs of refugees. Our teachers are<br/>
				all volunteers, and we are all extremely passionate about coding.<br/>
				 We believe talented refugees are a great opportunity for<br/>
				the software development world, we are here to give them a<br/>
				helping hand.
