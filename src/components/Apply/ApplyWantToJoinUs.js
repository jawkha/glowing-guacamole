          In our 6-month program we train talented refugees with and without a
          coding background in modern JavaScript software development. Our aim
          is to have our students land their first software development job
          after finishing our course, and we do everything we can to prepare
          them as well as possible. With our team of over 35 experienced senior
          developers we have created a program around the special needs of
          refugees. Our teachers are all volunteers, and we are all extremely
          passionate about coding. We believe talented refugees are a great
          opportunity for the software development world, we are here to give
          them a helping hand.
