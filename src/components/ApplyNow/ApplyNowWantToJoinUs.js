       <p>Our next Class "Class 12" starts on November 8</p>

       <p>Deadline for application: 20th October, 2017</p>

       <p>Every 2 months we start a new class with talented refugees who want to start their career in web-<br/>
       development. Weâ€™re looking for people who are very motivated and are willing to put in a lot of hours<br/>
        in order to become great at coding. You will need to have an intermediate level in English and you will <br/>
        need to study for around 25 hours per week, with a physical class every Sunday. (and occasional<br/>
         masterclasses during the week) We accept people living all over the Netherlands, and we pay for<br/>
         transportation costs (traintickets).</p>
