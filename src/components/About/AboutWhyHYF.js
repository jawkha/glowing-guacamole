			<p>
				Within the current group of refugees there is a lot of talent.
				However, the past teaches us that talented newcomers have
				trouble finding work in their new countries of residence. At the
				same time we see a very large demand on the job market for
				web-developers. A lot of companies struggle to grow because of
				the lack of qualified developers. Here we see an enormous
				opportunity for a win-win situation. By training refugees in
				web-development we increase their chances of employment
				significantly, and at the same time we increase the amount of
				developers on the job market.
