			<h2>What is HackYourFuture?</h2>
			<p>
				HackYourFuture is a code school (foundation) teaching computer
				programming to refugees. Our aim is to empower our students
				through coding and get them to work as software developers. With
				40 developers (all volunteers) we have created a 6-month program
				in which our students learn the fundamentals of web-development.
				After graduation we guide our students towards employment via
				our network. Besides learning our students how to code, we also
				teach them how to work on projects in a modern tech team.
			</p>
			<p>
				We teach every Sunday in Amsterdam, during the week we coach and
				support our students online with their homework. Throughout our
				course our students have multiple business visits, masterclasses
				from various tech experts, and get individual coaching in their
				career.
