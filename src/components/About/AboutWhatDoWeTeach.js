			<p>
				The core language we teach is JavaScript, and we teach our<br/>
				students HTML, CSS, Node, Angular, Express and Databasing in<br/>
				MySQL/MongoDB. However what we value most is that our students<br/>
				learn how to think like a programmer, how to solve problems, and<br/>
				how to manage a project. With this fundamental knowledge our<br/>
				students should be ready for their first web-developer job.
