			<p>
				The core language we teach is JavaScript, and we teach our
				students HTML, CSS, Node, Angular, Express and Databasing in
				MySQL/MongoDB. However what we value most is that our students
				learn how to think like a programmer, how to solve problems, and
				how to manage a project. With this fundamental knowledge our
				students should be ready for their first web-developer job.
